Hello there, stranger~

## About Me

### Self-Introduction

An anonymous guest on the internet, a transparent person in reality.
A coder, half a social phobic.

In the vast network universe, I am the dim stardust.
If you are fortunate enough to observe me, please do not forget my once flickering light.

Not yet beaten by society, an unemployed wanderer, still struggling through graduate school, and soon to be struggling with work.

Introverted by nature, I like to write code, listen to pure music, watch light-hearted cartoons, and play games (need company, single-player games are so boring).

I have a wide range of interests, but I am not proficient in any of them, so I am a person who knows nothing. I like to tinker, but I can't produce anything substantial.

## About This Site

### Theme

I have always been fond of static websites, but the front-end development is too fast, and the frameworks keep changing. Currently, I am using Astro, React, and TailwindCSS to build a static blog, hoping it will be outdated slower.
As for why I use Astro instead of frameworks like Next.js, it's because Astro provides a **usable** local content management system, so I don't have to reinvent the wheel.

The theme of this site is a mix of styles from various blogs, output after being blended in my mind, you may notice the shadow of any other site.
Currently, the site has not achieved content and theme independence, and Astro does not provide such functionality. I want to make the theme a separate plugin, but I haven't started yet.

### Timeline

- 2023-03-13 Purchased a new domain suborbit.net and deployed the site on Netlify;
- 2023-02-10 Rebuilt the blog using Astro, continued with the previous name Mercure, and iterated since then;
- 2021-05-05 Created a theme named Mercure using Hexo, but gave up due to increasing bugs and Hexo's difficulty in integrating with modern web frameworks. This later became the design prototype of this site;
- 2020-xx-xx Migrated the blog using Wordpress and bought a beautiful theme, the site is still growing;
- 2019-xx-xx Built the first blog using Hexo, but didn't write many articles;
- 2018-xx-xx Went through a phase of crazily modifying cnblogs styles, eventually creating a pile of decent-looking mess;
