## Introduction

On May 11, 2020, Bitcoin hit a milestone at block 630,000: the third halving cut the block reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, a moment when the cryptocurrency began to shed its volatile adolescence. By April 19, 2024, when the fourth halving dropped rewards to 3.125 BTC at block 840,000, Bitcoin was a \$1.2 trillion asset, steady at \$63,000-\$64,000. We’ve explored halving’s mechanics, history, and the 2012 and 2016 events—now, let’s turn to 2020, a turning point for Bitcoin’s maturity. In this ninth stop of our 30-part journey, we’ll unpack how the third halving navigated global chaos, institutional adoption, and network growth, paving the way for 2024’s milestone. Let’s step into Bitcoin’s coming-of-age story.

## Bitcoin in 2020: A Network Under Pressure

By 2020, Bitcoin was no longer a fringe idea. Priced at ~\$8,700 in May, its market cap neared \$160 billion. The hash rate soared to 100 exahashes per second, driven by industrial-scale mining from firms like Bitmain. Transactions averaged 300,000 monthly, boosted by the 2017 SegWit upgrade, which eased 2016’s congestion woes. Bitcoin’s narrative as a “store of value” gained traction, especially as COVID-19 rocked global markets.

The pandemic added urgency. Stocks crashed in March 2020, and central banks printed trillions, sparking inflation fears. Bitcoin, with its 21 million cap, emerged as a potential hedge. The third halving arrived amid this chaos, testing whether Bitcoin could live up to its “digital gold” promise while miners faced a reward cut.

## The Halving Event: Stability Amid Crisis

On May 11, 2020, at 7:23 p.m. UTC, block 630,000 triggered the halving. The reward dropped from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, reducing daily issuance from 1,800 BTC to 900 BTC—at \$8,700, that was a cut from \$15.66 million to \$7.83 million daily. The network, now battle-tested, handled it smoothly. Difficulty adjusted, maintaining the 10-minute block time, and the hash rate held steady despite the revenue hit.

Miners adapted better than in 2016. Larger operations, with efficient ASICs, absorbed the cut, while smaller players pivoted to cheaper energy sources. The halving’s predictability, coded into Bitcoin’s protocol, ensured stability—a trait echoed in 2024, when ViaBTC mined block 840,000 with a hash rate of 700 exahashes per second, seamlessly dropping to 3.125 BTC.

## The Aftermath: A Steady Climb to \$69,000

The 2020 halving set off a bull run, but it wasn’t instant. Prices dipped to \$8,200 post-event, then began a steady climb. By November 2021, Bitcoin hit \$69,000—a 700% rise over 18 months. The supply cut to 900 BTC/day tightened availability, while demand exploded. Institutional adoption fueled the surge: PayPal added BTC support, MicroStrategy invested \$425M, and Tesla bought \$1.5B in early 2021. The DeFi boom also drew users, with Bitcoin as a gateway asset.

Unlike 2016’s crash, the post-2020 dip was milder, bottoming at \$30,000 in mid-2021. This resilience signaled maturity—investors held, institutions stayed, and the network processed higher volumes. The 2020 halving’s steady growth contrasted with 2024’s muted \$63,000-\$64,000 post-halving price, reflecting a market less driven by speculation.

## Lessons for 2024: From Volatility to Stability

The 2020 halving offers key lessons for 2024. In 2020, Bitcoin’s hash rate was 100 exahashes; by 2024, it hit 700 exahashes, with Marathon Digital at 28.7 trillion hashes/second. The 2020 bull run was institution-driven; 2024’s \$73,000 pre-halving peak leaned on Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows (\$208M/day) and ordinals fees (~\$200M by February). Both events highlight scarcity’s role—2020’s 6.25 BTC reward led to 2024’s 3.125 BTC, with ~19.7 million BTC mined by now.

The 2020 halving showed Bitcoin could thrive amid crisis, a trait mirrored in 2024’s stability despite 3.5% U.S. inflation. Institutional trust in 2020 (e.g., MicroStrategy) evolved into 2024’s ETF mainstreaming. The third halving marked Bitcoin’s shift from volatile teen to steady adult, a foundation for 2024’s poised response.

## Conclusion

The third halving on May 11, 2020, cut rewards to 6.25 BTC, propelling Bitcoin to \$69,000 and signaling a maturing market. Its steady growth, fueled by institutions and resilience, laid the groundwork for 2024’s 3.125 BTC milestone—a calmer event in a more established ecosystem. The 2020 halving proved Bitcoin could grow up; 2024 showed it could stand firm. Next in Article 10, we’ll analyze halving price trends. What do you think made 2020 a turning point?
